# Pynetix

Pynetix is a tool for fitting data obtained from the _FLUEOstar Omega_ plate reader.
The application provides a GUI and an autofit function for data polluted with artifacts.
This tool is best for high troughput screenings, because it enables the visualization and
autofitting of kinetic data in 96 well-plate format as well as the export of the reaction velocity.
